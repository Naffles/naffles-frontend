# Blackjack History Display Configuration

## Decision: No Historical Results Display for Blackjack

### Reasoning

Unlike Coin Toss and Rock Paper Scissors games, **Blackjack does not display historical results** for the following reasons:

#### 1. **Game Nature Differences**
- **Coin Toss**: Simple binary outcome (heads/tails) that can provide pattern insights
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: System choice patterns can be strategically relevant to players
- **Blackjack**: Complex card game where previous hands have no statistical relevance to future hands

#### 2. **Statistical Independence**
- Each blackjack hand is dealt from a shuffled deck (8-deck system with Fisher-Yates algorithm)
- Previous hand outcomes do not influence future hand probabilities
- Displaying past results could mislead players into believing in "hot streaks" or "due outcomes"

#### 3. **Gambling Responsibility**
- Showing blackjack history could encourage problematic gambling behaviors
- Players might chase losses or believe in patterns that don't exist
- Responsible gaming practices discourage pattern-seeking in independent events

#### 4. **User Experience**
- Blackjack games are more complex and longer than coin toss or RPS
- Screen real estate is better used for game controls and card display
- Historical data would add visual clutter without strategic value

#### 5. **Industry Standards**
- Professional casino blackjack tables don't display hand history
- Online casino implementations typically don't show previous hand results
- Following established gambling industry practices

### Implementation

The `GameHistoryDisplay` component includes built-in logic to return `null` for blackjack:

```typescript
// Don't render anything for blackjack
if (gameType === 'blackjack') {
  return null;
}
```

### Interface Consistency

While blackjack doesn't display history, it maintains consistent interface structure with other games:
- Same responsive design principles
- Consistent button layouts and styling
- Uniform game container structure
- Compatible with the unified gaming interface

This ensures a cohesive user experience across all games while respecting the unique characteristics of each game type.

### Future Considerations

If analytics or player statistics are needed for blackjack, they should be:
- Aggregated over longer periods (sessions, not individual hands)
- Focused on overall performance metrics rather than hand-by-hand results
- Displayed in a separate analytics section, not as real-time history during gameplay
